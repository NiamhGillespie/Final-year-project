## What is RViT?
RViT is a requirements and value identification tool for prioritisation developed by Niamh Gillespie for her final year dissertation.

RViT draws on key agile methodologies and concepts to provide an easy-to-use project management tool. RViT also uses value statements which can be linked to epics or stories to allow team members and stakeholders to understand the values that an epic or story will add to a project.

Some example values include: 'Customer Satisfaction', 'Cost Reduction' and 'Automation'

## How to use RViT - admin user
When you set up an organisation with RViT, you will have to create an admin account in the process.

When logged into an admin account you can add teams and users as well as view, edit, and delete these different profiles.

A variety of user types exist; admins, team leads, team members and stakeholders. Only team leads, team members and stakeholders can view their relevant team's dashboards. For more information on the permissions of each of these user types please see the other help sections.

## How to use RViT - team member and team lead users
oth team leads and team members have access to a number of different dashboards designed to incorporate different areas of the agile process. As both team leads and team members can be part of multiple teams, each dashboard can be toggled between the set of teams that a user belongs to.

### Tag dashboard
The tag dashboard allows users to add and edit tags and values. Tags typically will be used to classify the skills an user story will need and are only available to be used on stories. Whereas values are used to identify the value that either an epic or story will bring to a project.

Both tags and values have an optional description field and are fully colour customisable.

### Team dashboard
The team dashboard provides quick access to a team's set of dashboards and provides a list of the users belonging to the team.

There is also a team statistics section which in the future will feature useful agile metrics such as burndown charts and team velocity data. Future development would also ideally allow for these metrics to be exported as a report.

### Tracking dashboard
The tracking dashboard is a customisable kanban board, designed to allow users to visualise workflow. Users can define tracking columns with optional WIP (Work In Progress) limits, add stories to these columns and move these stories both horizontally and vertically through the columns. Time based filters also allow users to filter the stories based on the last time the story was edited.

### Epics dashboard
The epics dashboard allows users to define and edit epics and stories. Once added to the dashboard, epics can be ordered horizontally and stories vertically to visualise priority. Users can add values to the epics and both values and tags to user stories.

The epics dashboard can also be filtered to show all epics and stories, only the uncompleted epics and stories and finally only the completed epics and stories.

The dashboard also features a small number of simple metrics which will be expanded on in the future.
