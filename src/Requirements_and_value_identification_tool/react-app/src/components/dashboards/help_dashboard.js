                            RViT is a requirements and value identification tool for prioritisation developed by Niamh Gillespie for her final year
                            dissertation.

                            RViT draws on key agile methodologies and concepts to provide an easy-to-use project management tool. RViT also uses value
                            statements which can be linked to epics or stories to allow team members and stakeholders to understand the values that an
                            epic or story will add to a project.

                            Both team leads and team members have access to a number of different dashboards designed to incorporate different areas
                            of the agile process. As both team leads and team members can be part of multiple teams, each dashboard can be toggled
                            between the set of teams that a user belongs to.

                            The tag dashboard allows users to add and edit tags and values. Tags typically will be used to classify the skills an user
                            story will need and are only available to be used on stories. Whereas values are used to identify the value that either an
                            epic or story will bring to a project.

                            The team dashboard provides quick access to a team's set of dashboards and provides a list of the users belonging to the
                            team.

                            There is also a team statistics section which in the future will feature useful agile metrics such as burndown charts and
                            team velocity data. Future development would also ideally allow for these metrics to be exported as a report.

                            The tracking dashboard is a customisable kanban board, designed to allow users to visualise workflow. Users can define
                            tracking columns with optional WIP (Work In Progress) limits, add stories to these columns and move these stories both
                            horizontally and vertically through the columns. Time based filters also allow users to filter the stories based on they
                            last changed tracking column.

                            The epics dashboard allows users to define and edit epics and stories. Once added to the dashboard, epics can be ordered
                            horizontally and stories vertically to visualise priority. Users can add values to the epics and both values and tags to
                            user stories.

                            The epics dashboard can also be filtered to show all epics and stories, only the uncompleted epics and stories and finally
